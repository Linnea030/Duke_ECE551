Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid line format for pagenum!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid line format for page type!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story4 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
No such pagenum!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story5 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
No such pagenum!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.6: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story6 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Negative integer!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.7: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story7 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid integer!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.8: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story8 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Win or Lose type can not have choice!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.9: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story9 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.10: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1  <  story1/input0.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
/dev/fd/3: line 528: story1/input0.txt: No such file or directory
But we did not.
------------------------------------

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step3' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


3.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid line format for pagenum!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


3.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid line format for page type!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


3.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story4 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
No such pagenum!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


3.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story5 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
No such pagenum!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


3.6: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story6 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Negative integer!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


3.7: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story7 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid integer!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


3.8: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story8 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Win or Lose type can not have choice!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


3.9: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story9 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step4 -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall cyoa-step4.cpp readStory.hpp readStory.cpp page.hpp page.cpp choice.hpp choice.cpp pstory.hpp pstory.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 4

You have NOT passed your test cases!
You should go and figure out/understand where thing went wrong
And fix the problem(s) before the deadline
