Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid line format for pagenum!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid line format for page type!

1.6: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story6 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Negative integer!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.7: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story7 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid integer!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.8: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story8 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Win or Lose type can not have choice!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.9: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story9 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case
Intermediate deadline requirements for Step 1 passed at Wed Dec  7 05:03:15 PM EST 2022

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step2 -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall cyoa-step2.cpp readStory.hpp readStory.cpp page.hpp page.cpp choice.hpp choice.cpp pstory.hpp pstory.cpp
