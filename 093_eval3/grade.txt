Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall cyoa-step1.cpp readStory.hpp readStory.cpp page.hpp page.cpp choice.hpp choice.cpp pstory.hpp pstory.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
