Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall cyoa-step1.cpp readStory.hpp readStory.cpp page.hpp page.cpp choice.hpp choice.cpp pstory.hpp pstory.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 ~/ece551/093_eval3/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Open file failed!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 ~/ece551/093_eval3/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Open file failed!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case
Intermediate deadline requirements for Step 1 passed at Wed Dec  7 02:53:02 PM EST 2022

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step2 -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall cyoa-step2.cpp readStory.hpp readStory.cpp page.hpp page.cpp choice.hpp choice.cpp pstory.hpp pstory.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step3' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 ~/ece551/093_eval3/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Open file failed!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step4 -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall cyoa-step4.cpp readStory.hpp readStory.cpp page.hpp page.cpp choice.hpp choice.cpp pstory.hpp pstory.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 4

You have passed the test cases YOU provided
If your tests are good, this is great. 
If your tests are insufficient, you should do much more testing

Overall Grade: NO GRADE YET
