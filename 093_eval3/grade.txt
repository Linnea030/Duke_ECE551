Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step2' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/inputs/input0.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


2.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/inputs/input0.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/inputs/input3.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step3' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


3.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step4' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------


4.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs/input0.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


4.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


4.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs/input2.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


4.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs/input3.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


4.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs/input4.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


4.6: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs/input5.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!
But we did not.


4.7: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs/input6.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
No such pagenum!

You have NOT passed your test cases!
You should go and figure out/understand where thing went wrong
And fix the problem(s) before the deadline
