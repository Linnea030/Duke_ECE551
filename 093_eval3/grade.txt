Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o readStory.o pstory.o page.o choice.o
g++  -c readStory.cpp
g++  -c pstory.cpp
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c choice.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o readStory.o pstory.o page.o choice.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
