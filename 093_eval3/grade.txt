Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step2 -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall cyoa-step2.cpp readStory.hpp readStory.cpp page.hpp page.cpp choice.hpp choice.cpp pstory.hpp pstory.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/input1.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
/dev/fd/3: line 528: /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/input1.txt: No such file or directory
But we did not.


2.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2  <  /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/input1.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
/dev/fd/3: line 528: /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/input1.txt: No such file or directory
But we did not.
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step3' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


3.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

							      >	0(1),1(2),5(1),6(1),8(1),11(win)
							      >	0(1),1(2),5(2),7(1),10(win)
0(2),2(win)							0(2),2(win)
Your file did not match the expected output

------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3
------------------------------------

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
Your output differs from ours.
Below is the diff (yours left/ours right)
							      >	0(1),1(2),5(1),6(1),8(1),11(win)
							      >	0(1),1(2),5(2),7(1),10(win)
0(2),2(win)							0(2),2(win)
Your file did not match the expected output

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
The code did not compile!
