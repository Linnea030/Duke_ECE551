Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Your file matched the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind showed memory leaks
Valgrind reported errors or memory leaks:
==164461== Memcheck, a memory error detector

==164461== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
==164461== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all
==164461== 
==164461== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==164461== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
The code did not compile!
